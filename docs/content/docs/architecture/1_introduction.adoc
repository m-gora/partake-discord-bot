This document shall guide architects and software engineers through the requirements and design decisions taken for the partake discord bot. The bot's purpose is to reduce frictions between discord and partake when managing events.

## 1.1. Requirements Overview
The main features include:

- Simultaneous creation of Partake events and posts on discord
- Guided event creation with customizable templates
- Search for events within discord
- Embedding events in discord posts and one-click attending of events

Event organizers will be able to create post templates for their event posts. As soon as Partake supports the new editor with markdown support, these templates will be used for both discord posts and partake event creation, to be consistent with the styling.
Event creation will be guided with fillable forms which are dynamically generated from templates, which can be customized by the organizers. Events created this way will have a button below the post, which lets people attend the event without going to Partake,
provided they have a registered account.
